## Improved Prediction of MHC-peptide Binding using Protein Language Models
This repository is associated with the paper titled "Improved Prediction of MHC-peptide Binding using Protein Language Models." In the study, we explore the application of deep learning models pretrained on large datasets of protein sequences to predict MHC Class I-peptide binding.

Our models have been evaluated using standard performance metrics in this field, as well as the same training and test sets. The results demonstrate that our models outperform NetMHCpan4.1, which is currently considered the state-of-the-art method.
